# discord-plugins-bot
This is a template that can be used to develop a discord bot base on a plugin system.  
A plugin represents a functionnality with its own events handler and commands.  
It allows the code to be cleaner and to not mix different functionnalities with each other in the same events' files.

Even though this template is using Typescript, you can add your plugins in Javascript as it is compatible with TS.

You can go to the [wiki](../../wiki) to see a tutorial on how to use this bot.
